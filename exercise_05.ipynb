    "### Wikidata \n",
    "is a dataset proposed to better organise the data of Wikipedia (used for lists, tables, infoboxes, etc.) in a central, language-agnostic, structured repository. Wikidata is used not only by Wikipedia, but also Google, Alexa, Siri, etc. The dataset is published using Semantic Web standards and provides a SPARQL endpoint that we will use for today's lab to try out some SPARQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to <a>http://query.wikidata.org/</a>. Here you will find the SPARQL interface for Wikidata.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Tips on querying Wikidata: \n",
    "- In order to find identifiers for entities (like `wd:Q515`) you can write `wd:` in the interface, hold **Ctrl** and press **Spacebar**; this opens a search box were you can type (e.g.) `chile` and get suggested identifiers. On the other hand, for properties, you can type `wdt:` and then hold **Ctrl** and press **Spacebar**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Wikidata uses its own properties for some properties already defined by the W3C standards. The property `wdt:P31` denotes *instance-of*, which serves the same role as `rdf:type`. The property `wdt:P279` denotes *sub-class-of* which serves the same role as `rdfs:subClassOf`. The expression `wdt:P31/wdt:P279*` is called a *property path*, and it matches nodes connected to `?city` by one `wdt:P31` edge and zero-or-many `wdt:P279` edges; we will talk more about this feature in the next class but for now it suffices to know that the expression `wdt:P31/wdt:P279*` matches instances of classes and transitive sub-classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Wikidata provides human-readable labels for entities in many languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, please provide queries to answer the following. "
